Center of electrostatic potential X(5626)
====================

This repository containes a few routines for numerical calculation of Center of electrostatic potential, characteristic triangle point X(5626). Routines are mainly written in Wolfram Mathematica, but practical approximation is also implemented in C and Python.

Center of electrostatic potential is a maximum point of electrostatic potential of homogeneous charge distribution on a triangle domain. It's also a point of zero electric field of the same charge distribution. A lot of technical details can be found in an article 'From electrostatic potentials to yet another triangle center' by Hrvoje Abraham and Vjekoslav Kovac (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.3176v2.pdf).
