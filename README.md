Center of electrostatic potential X(5626)
=========================================

This repository containes a few routines for numerical calculation of Center of electrostatic potential, characteristic triangle point X(5626). Routines are mainly written in Wolfram Mathematica, but practical approximation is also implemented in C and Python.

Center of electrostatic potential is a maximum point of electrostatic potential of homogeneous charge distribution on a triangle domain. It's also a point of zero electric field of the same charge distribution. A lot of technical details can be found in an article *'From electrostatic potentials to yet another triangle center'* by Hrvoje Abraham and Vjekoslav Kovac. (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.3176v2.pdf)

Center is also incorporated into Kimberling's Encoclopedia of triangle centers as X(5626) point. (http://faculty.evansville.edu/ck6/encyclopedia/ETCPart4.html)
